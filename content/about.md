title: About Adventures in Randerful Life
author: Yi LIU
---

This blog was created to record memorable things in life. As a result, they can be about any aspect of my life: family, friends, travel, work, etc.

The name may need a bit clarification: I consider life as both random and wonderful, thus the word Randerful (=Ran(dom) + (won)derfu). The posts will be in Chinese or English. As I am not a native Engligh speaker, please forgive my English. (Anyway, I am not particularly good at Chinese either. So forgive my Chinese too). And the posts may be written by me, my wife, or other friends.

Bonne lecture.
