<p>This is the place to record memorable things in my life. Life is a journey with trip and falls, so I consider it random. There are a lot of things I am grateful to, and I would like to say that life is wonderful. Thus the name of the blog: adventures in randerful (=ran(dom+won)derful) life.</p>
<p>The blogs will mainly be written by myself and my wife. They can be about any aspect of life: about work, about friends, about family, or even about food. I intend to write in English and Chinese with no clear rules. But since I am not a native speaker of English, please read with a bit of caution and tolerance. (However, I am not particularly good at Chinese either. So be careful too.)</p>
